I developed a personalized portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my professional work and expand my professional network. The website features a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore my projects, skills, and experiences. With interactive elements powered by JavaScript, such as animations and dynamic content, the site offers a visually engaging experience for potential employers and collaborators. Through this platform, I aim to enhance my online presence, showcase my capabilities, and connect with opportunities in my field.
